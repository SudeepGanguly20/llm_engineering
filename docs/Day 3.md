**Note - Perplexity is actually a search engine that uses frontier models to answer questions.
They also have their own models like the "Perplexity AI" model.**


# Conclusion
Note - All the models are excellent in generating response specific to our questions. SOme maybe more capable in some field than others , but with constant evolution each one is more or less very very good. Therefore then the differentiating factors in adoptability of these models becomes the prices of the models.
